	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>In olden times, when <span class='foo'>wishing</span> still helped, there lived a <strong>king</strong> whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which had seen so many things, was always filled with amazement each time it cast its rays upon her face. Now, there was a great dark forest near the king's castle, and in this forest, beneath an old linden tree, was a well.</p>
	<p class='foo'>Whenever the days were very hot, the king's daughter would go into this forest and sit down by the edge of the cool well. If she became bored, she would take her golden ball, throw it into the air, and catch it. More than anything else she loved playing with this ball.</p>
